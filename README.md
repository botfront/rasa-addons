### Parameters

##### fallback_trigger

Float (default ``0.30``): if confidence of top-ranking intent is below this threshold, fallback is triggered. Fallback is an action that utters the template ``utter_fallback`` and returns to the previous conversation state.

##### disambiguation_trigger

String (default ``'$0 < 2 * $1'``): if this expression holds, disambiguation is triggered. (If it has already been triggered on the previous turn, fallback is triggered instead.) Here this expression resolves to "the score of the top-ranking intent is below twice the score of the second-ranking intent". Disambiguation is an action that lets the user to choose from the top-ranking intents using a button prompt.

In addition, an 'Other' option is shown with payload defined in ``deny_suggestions`` param is shown. It is up to the conversation designer to implement a story to handle the continuation of this interaction.

##### deny_suggestions

String: the intent associated in the payload for the 'Other' option.

##### n_suggestions

Int (default 3): the maximum number of suggestions to display (excluding the 'Other' option).

##### excluded_intents

List (regex string): any intent (exactly) matching one of these regular expressions will not be shown as a suggestion.

##### disambiguation_title

Dict (language string -> string): localized disambiguation message title.

##### intent_mappings

Dict (intent string -> language string -> string): localized representative button title for intents. If no title is defined for a given intent, the intent name is rendered instead. These titles support entity substitution: any entity name enclosed in curly brackets (``{entity}``) will be filled with entity information from the user utterance.

_Important:_ The title for the 'Other' option is also defined here.

## rasa_addons.core.policies.BotfrontMappingPolicy

This policy implements regular expression-based direct mapping from intent to action.

### Example usage

```
policies:
...
  - name: rasa_addons.core.policies.BotfrontMappingPolicy
    triggers:
      - trigger: '^map\..+'
        action: 'action_botfront_mapping'
        extra_actions:
          - 'action_myaction'
...
```

### ActionBotfrontMapping

The default action ActionBotfrontMapping takes the intent that triggered the mapping policy, e.g. ``map.my_intent`` and tries to generate the template ``utter_map.my_intent``.
